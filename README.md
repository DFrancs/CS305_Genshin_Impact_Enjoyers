# CS305_Genshin_Impact_Enjoyers

For this project, I will be uploading **my** email spam-bot project _I_ wrote a few years ago for a used car dealership down in **_Phoenix_**.
I've begun repurposing it to send out a chore chart text message via email utilizing SMTP protocols in python. It does not work anymore due to recent changes by Google to reduce spam. Boy oh boy am I sure that that's working out real well for them.
